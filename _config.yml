    I am a PhD student at the Computer Architecture Group (gaZ) at the University
    of Zaragoza under the supervision of [Pablo Ibañez](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~peimarin/) 
    and [Jesús Alastruey](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~chus/). Before that I took 
    my BSc and M.Eng at the University of Zaragoza (2012-2018)

    My research interests focus on Computer Architecture, specifically on the
    distribution of hardware resources by software and memory hierarchy.
